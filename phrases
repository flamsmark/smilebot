You are wonderful.
You make the people around you happy.
The world is better with you in it.
You make me lolz.
You are insightful.
You brighten my day.
You are made of star stuff, and that's pretty cool.

You brighten my day.
You are the architect of a better future.
You are courageous.
You're cool, let's be friends.
If I could travel back in time, I'd high-five your parents when you were born.
You're all heart.
You're like a real life Adventure Time character.
You are as wise as Obi-Wan.
You're worth it!
I believe in you.
Your code is beautiful and I would run it in production!
